# JNBP

This is a java client for the NBP currency exchange rates API.

[Narodowy Bank Polski](http://www.nbp.pl/) or NBP is the central bank of the
Republic of Poland. Among other tasks it publishes the official exchange rate
of ZÅ‚oty (the Polish currency) against other currencies. [NBP provides an
API to access the exchange rates](http://api.nbp.pl/en.html).

**Note** This is a work in progress.

## Thin client

This is a thin wrapper around the API provided by NBP. Its aim is to provide 
a 1:1 implementation of the functions available in the NBP Currency Exchange
API.
 
#### Examples

See the [Demo.java](./src/main/java/info/kupczynski/jnbp/Demo.java) class.

- Create the client
  ```java
  JNbpClient client = new JNbpClient();
  ```

- Queries for particular currency
    
    * Current mid-market exchange rate for "EUR" in table "A" 
        ```java
        CurrencyRates rates = client.current(Currency.EUR_A);
        ```
        
        *returns*:
        ```
        CurrencyRates{currency=EUR_A, rates=[
            DailyRate{rateId='214/A/NBP/2016', effectiveDate=2016-11-04, mid=4.3133, bid=null, ask=null}
        ]}
        ```
    
    * Series of latest 3 exchange rates
        ```java
        CurrencyRates rates = client.latest(Currency.EUR_A, 3);
        ```
        
        *returns*:
        ```
        CurrencyRates{currency=EUR_A, rates=[

    * Exchange rate for today (may not exist)
        ```java

        ```
        
        *returns*:
        ```
        Optional[

        ]
        ```
    
    * Exchange rate between two dates 
        ```java

        *returns*:

        ]}                
        ```
    
    * Less popular currencies are updated once a week and stored in table "B"
